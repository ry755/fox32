# fox32

**fox32** (stylized in all lowercase) is a 32 bit fantasy computer architecture, with a custom operating system and user interface inspired by various classic computers.

## Getting Started

**Note: This software is still very much in an early stage, and is currently more focused towards developers rather than end-users.**

The full **fox32** suite mainly consists of 4 components, each seperated into their own directory. See their README files for more info:
 - [fox32](fox32/README.md) - the virtual machine itself
 - [fox32asm](fox32asm/README.md) - the fox32 assembler
 - [fox32rom](fox32rom/README.md) - a collection of commonly-used routines
 - fox32os (planned) - a multitasking operating system with a simple windowing system

Documentation is a work-in-progress.
