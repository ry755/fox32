# fox32

**fox32** (stylized in all lowercase) is a 32 bit fantasy computer architecture, with a custom operating system and user interface inspired by various classic computers.

## Getting Started

**Note: This software is still very much in an early stage, and is currently more focused towards developers rather than end-users.**

### Usage

**fox32** attempts to read its ROM from a file called `fox32.rom` in the current directory. If this file isn't found then it falls back to `../fox32rom/fox32.rom`, and if this file isn't found then it exits.

See [encoding.md](encoding.md) for information about the instruction set.
